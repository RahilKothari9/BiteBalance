# [BiteBalance](https://bitebalance.vercel.app)

[BiteBalance](https://bitebalance.vercel.app) is a MERN stack web application designed to track your daily calorie and macro intake through photo recognition. Users can take photos of their meals to estimate calories and macronutrients, and also generate creative recipes based on ingredients and dietary preferences.

## Features

- **Photo-based Calorie & Macro Recognition**: Upload a photo of your meal to recognize calories and macros (protein, carbs, fats, sugars, sodium) using Google Gemini AI.
- **Ingredient-based Recipe Generation**: Take a photo of your ingredients, enter dietary preferences, and generate recipes that meet your specified cooking time and difficulty.
- **Daily Nutrition Tracking**: Track calories and macros for each day, view consolidated stats over the past few days.
- **User Authentication**: Firebase authentication for user login and registration.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: For building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Material UI (MUI)**: Component library used for modern, responsive design.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user login and registration.

### Backend:
- **Node.js & Express**: Handle API requests and data processing.
- **Google Gemini AI**: Powers the image-based meal recognition and recipe generation.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-hosted NoSQL database for storing user data (calories, macros, etc.).
